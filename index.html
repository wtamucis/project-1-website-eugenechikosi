      <h2>Welcome to Gina’s Pastries</h2>

      <p>
        At Gina’s Pastries, baking is more than a craft,it is a heartfelt tradition. 
        Each recipe is inspired by a deep love for creating warm, comforting treats that 
        bring people together. From the very first whisk to the final touch of frosting, 
        every pastry is made with attention to detail, quality ingredients, and the kind 
        of joy that can only come from doing what you truly love.Since I was a young girl, 
        I have always loved baking and creating beautiful, 
        comforting food. What started as a childhood passion quickly became a lifelong 
        joy, and every recipe I create carries the same warmth, creativity, and love 
        that inspired me from the beginning.
